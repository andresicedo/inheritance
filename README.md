## Description

Class Inheritance - A class is like a blueprint; a description of the object 
to be created. Class inheritance is a way for a class to extend another 
class and create new functionality on top of the existing, in other words, 
classes inherit from other classes and created subclass relationships. Classes 
use constructor methods to set properties using the "this" keyword. 

Prototypal inheritance - When we read a property from an object and it's missing, 
Javascript takes the property from the prototype, in programming, this is called 
prototypal inheritance. In Javascript, object have a special hidden property 
"Prototype", that is either null, or redefines another object. That object is 
called a prototype.

Javascript is a prototype based language. When you create an object, that object 
automatically gets a prototype and if there is a property or method that is not 
in the object, Javascript will reference the prototype, looking to see if it exists.
